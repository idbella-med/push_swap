# push_swap
"Push_swap" is a popular coding challenge, typically found in coding bootcamps or competitive programming environments, especially in the context of algorithms and data structures.

The challenge involves sorting a stack of numbers with a limited set of operations, and the goal is to achieve the sorting in the smallest number of moves possible. Here's a brief overview:

Problem:
You have two stacks: Stack A (which contains a list of unsorted numbers) and Stack B (which starts empty). You need to sort the numbers in Stack A in ascending order by performing a series of operations.

Allowed Operations:
sa: Swap the top two elements of Stack A.
sb: Swap the top two elements of Stack B.
ss: Perform both sa and sb simultaneously.
pa: Push the top element of Stack B to Stack A.
pb: Push the top element of Stack A to Stack B.
ra: Rotate Stack A (move the top element to the bottom).
rb: Rotate Stack B (move the top element to the bottom).
rr: Perform both ra and rb simultaneously.
rra: Reverse rotate Stack A (move the bottom element to the top).
rrb: Reverse rotate Stack B (move the bottom element to the top).
rrr: Perform both rra and rrb simultaneously.
Goal:
You need to sort the elements in Stack A in ascending order, using as few operations as possible.
The challenge usually emphasizes solving the problem efficiently, especially when the list of numbers is large.
Key Concepts:
Stacks: Stack A holds the numbers, and Stack B is used as temporary storage.
Sorting Algorithms: You have to think creatively and implement efficient sorting algorithms using only these operations.
The challenge is a great way to improve your problem-solving skills and understanding of algorithmic optimization.
